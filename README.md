I used ChatGPT to debug some errors.
On inspecting the data, there appears to be atypo in the third instance where the population size is 6O1994, most likely it was supposed to be a 0 not O. 
Also, the population coumn should be numeric.
There are inconsistencies with commas as well, some population values have commas and most don't have. The 20th and 27th row have very huge values that appear unrealistic, so I drop them.
